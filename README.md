# 3d-maze-explorer

A lightweight 3D maze game built to master the modern OpenGL pipeline. this project uses a shader-based approach with C++20 and the latest SFML 3



Technologies & Tools Used:
- C++20
- SFML 3.0.2: For windowing, input, and OpenGL context management.
- GLAD: As the OpenGL function loader.
- GLM: For the 3D matrix and vector mathematics.

How to Build
- Clone the repo.
- Ensure you have a C++20 compatible compiler and CMake installed.
- Run cmake -B build and cmake --build build.
- The assets (shaders and textures) will automatically copy to the build folder.
